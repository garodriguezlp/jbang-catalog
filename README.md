# garodriguezlp's Personal JBang Catalog!

Welcome! ðŸ‘‹ This is the official repository for my Java and occasionally Kotlin CLI tools. If you appreciate Java and hassle-free
tool execution without a build system, you've found the right place!

## What's a JBang Catalog Anyway?

A JBang catalog is a menu for Java apps, allowing you to run and share them easily without Maven or Gradle. Learn more in the
[JBang documentation](https://www.jbang.dev/documentation/guide/latest/alias_catalogs.html).
